      "Introduction: \n",
      " \n",
      "The significance of large annotated corpora in the present day NLP is \n",
      "widely known. Annotated corpora serve as an important tool for \n",
      "investigators of natural language processing, speech recognition and \n",
      "other related areas. It proves to be a basic building block for \n",
      "constructing statistical models for automatic processing of natural \n",
      "languages.  \n",
      " \n",
      "Many such corpora are available for languages across the world and have \n",
      "proved to be a useful step towards natural language processing. \n",
      " \n",
      "Looking at the scenario for Indian languages, not much work has been \n",
      "carried out in the front of automatic processing of Hindi or any other \n",
      "Indian language. The main bottleneck being unavailability of an \n",
      "annotated corpus large enough to experiment statistical algorithms.  \n",
      " \n",
      "Annotation of corpora can be done at various levels viz, Part of \n",
      "Speech, Phrase/clause level, dependancy level, etc. Part of speech \n",
      "tagging can form a basic step towards building an annotated corpus. \n",
      "This level of tagging can be further extended to higher levels of \n",
      "annotation.  \n",
      " \n",
      " \n",
      "Objectives: \n",
      " \n",
      "This paper mainly aims at arriving at a standard tagset for part of \n",
      "speech annotation for all Indian languages. It gives a detail \n",
      "description of the various tags used and elaborates the motivations \n",
      "behind the selection of these tags.  \n",
      " \n",
      "This paper also discusses various issues that need to be addressed \n",
      "while preparing a tagset for a POS tagger and how we have tried to \n",
      "solve each one of these in the current tagger.  \n",
      " \n",
      "Later the paper also gives a short analysis of some phenomena which are \n",
      "specific to Indian languages and how this tagger has tried to deal with \n",
      "these. \n",
      " \n",
      " \n",
      "Organization of the paper: \n",
      " \n",
      "This paper has been divided in three sections. Each of these sections \n",
      "discusses the three objectives of the paper. \n",
      " \n",
      "Section I Various issues involved in deciding a tagset for a POS \n",

      "Section I: \n",
      " \n",
      "This section deals with some of the issues related to any POS tagger \n",
      "and the policy that we have adopted to deal with each of these issues \n",
      "in the current tagger. \n",
      "  \n",
      "In case of a POS tagger, the major issues that need to be dealt with are: \n",
      " \n",
      "1. Fineness V/s Coarseness in linguistic analysis \n",
      "2. Syntactic Function V/s lexical category \n",
      "3. New tags V/s tags from a standard tagger \n",
      " \n",
      "1. Fineness V/s Coarseness  \n",
      " \n",
      "An issue which always comes up while deciding a tagset for annotating \n",
      "any text is of 'fineness' or 'coarseness' in linguistic analysis. In \n",
      "case of a POS tagger a decision has to be taken whether the tags will \n",
      "account for finer distinctions of the various features of the parts of \n",
      "speech. In other words it has to be decided if plurality, gender and \n",
      "such other information will be marked distinctly or only the lexical \n",
      "category will be marked.  \n",
      " \n",
      "In this tagset we have avoided 'fine' distinction. The motivation \n",
      "behind this is to have less number of tags since less number of tags \n",
      "leads to efficient machine learning. Also accuracy of manual tagging is \n",
      "higher when the number of tags is less. \n",
      " \n",
      "But we also agree that too coarse an analysis is not of much use. \n",
      "Essentially, we need to strike a balance between fineness and \n",
      "coarseness. The analysis should not be so fine as to hamper machine \n",
      "learning and also should not be so course as to loose important \n",
      "information. \n",
      " \n",
      "The results of an experiment conducted in the center, shows how more \n",
      "number of tags hampers machine learning. \n",
      " \n",
      "??In this experiment, initially the noun class was divided into NO \n",
      "(noun oblique) and ND (noun direct). The learning data was of 20K \n",
      "words.  \n",
      " \n",
      "So in case of nouns we have not taken into account the plurality \n",
      "information i.e. we have not marked noun singular and noun plural with \n",
      "different tags. Nouns in Indian languages also inflect for case (direct \n",
      "and oblique). This information too has not been marked distinctly. \n",
      " \n",
      "In case of adjectives and adverbs we have avoided the distinction \n",
      "between comparative and superlative forms. \n",
      " \n",
      "Also, we feel that fine distinctions are not relevant for many of the \n",
      "applications (like sentence level parsing, dependancy marking, etc.) \n",
      "for which the tagger may be used in future. \n",
      " \n",
      "However we agree that plurality and such other information is crucial \n",
      "if the POS tagged corpus is used for any application which needs the \n",
      "agreement information. In case such information is needed at a later \n",
      "stage, the same tagset can be extended and can encompass plurality or \n",
      "case information also. This can be done by providing certain heuristics \n",
      "or linguistic rules.  \n",
      " \n",
      "Thus broadly we have adopted a coarse part of speech analysis.  \n",
      " \n",
      "But finer analysis is made wherever it is found essential. \n",
      " \n",
      "e.g. VJJ, VRB, VNN \n",
      " \n",
      "For example, in case this tagger is used for dependancy parsing or any \n",
      "such application, it is essential to preserve the information that the \n",
      "given word is a noun or an adjective or an adverb which is formed from \n",
      "a verb. This helps in understanding the various arguments that this \n",
      "verbal noun/adjective/adverb can take. \n",
      " \n",
      "In other words the non-finite forms of verbs which are used as nouns or \n",
      "adjectives or adverbs still retain their property of being a verb, for \n",
      "example even in the participle form they can take their own arguments \n",
      "in a sentence. In such a case it is essential that the tag for this \n",
      "participle word indicates that the word is a form of a verb, so that \n",
      "its dependancy structure may be established. \n",
      " \n",
      "e.g. AsamAna/NN meM/PREP uDane/VNN vAlA/PREP ghoDA/NN nIce/NLOC  \n",
      "      \"sky\"      \"in\"    \"flying\"            \"horse   \"down\"      \n",
      "utara/VFM AyA/VAUX. \n",
      "\"climb\"   \"came\" \n",
      " \n",
      "In the above sentence 'uDane' is VNN, it is a noun formed from a verb. \n",
      "And 'AsamAna' is an argument of this verb and not the main verb of the \n",
      "sentence. So in order to preserve such crucial information a finer \n",
      "analysis is essential and so a distinct tag is used for gerunds. \n",
      "Similarly different tags are used for adjectival and adverbial \n",
      "participles too. \n",
      " \n",
      "2. Syntactic Function V/s lexical category \n",
      " \n",
      "The part of speech of a word in a sentence can be different from its \n",
      "lexical category. \n",
      " \n",
      "e.g. uttara - noun (lexical category) \n",
      "    (\"North\") \n",
      "uttara bhArata me bhArI varRA HuI. - adjective (syntactic category) \n",
      "(\"north\" \"India\" \"in\" \"lots\" \"rain\" \"happened\") \n",
      " \n",
      "??(jEse)  \n",
      " \n",
      "In such cases a decision has to be taken whether the word should be \n",
      "tagged according to its lexical category or the syntactic category. \n",
      " \n",
      "In this tagger, the syntactic function of the word is not given as much \n",
      "importance. Pure lexical category of the word is taken into \n",
      "consideration while tagging. Since the word is always tagged according \n",
      "to its lexical category there is consistency in tagging. This reduces \n",
      "confusion involved in manual tagging. Also the machine is able to \n",
      "establish a word-tag relation which leads to efficient machine \n",
      "learning.  \n",
      " \n",
      "3. New tags V/s tags from a standard tagger \n",
      " \n",
      "While deciding the tags for a tagger one can either come up with a \n",
      "totally new tagset or take any other standard tagger as a reference and \n",
      "make modifications in it according to the objective of the new tagger. \n",
      "The later option is often better to adopt because it is expected that \n",
      "the end users of the tagger are familiar with the standard tagset for \n",
      "one language. They can easily adopt a similar tagset for a new language \n",
      "than a totally new one. It saves time in getting familiar to the new \n",
      "tagset and then work on it. \n",
      "  \n",
      "The Penn tagset is a standard tagset used for English. Many tagsets \n",
      "designed after these have been a variant of this tagset (e.g. Lancaster \n",
      "tagset). So while deciding the tags for this tagger, the Penn tagset \n",
      "has been used as a benchmark. Since the Penn tagset is an established \n",
      "tagset for English, we have extended it to another family of languages. \n",
      "Certain changes have been made in the tags only to make it suitable for \n",
      "Indian languages. Wherever the Penn tags are found to be inadequate for \n",
      "Indian languages, either new tags are introduced or existing tags are \n",
      "modified. \n",
      " \n",
      "e.g. NVB - new tag for Kriyamuls or light verbs.  \n",
      "    QW - modified tag for question words. \n",
      " \n",
      "Section II: \n",
      " \n",
      "This section gives the rationale behind each tag used in this tagger. \n",
      " \n",
      "All the tags used in this tagger are broadly classified into three \n",
      "types. There are some tags which have been adopted with some minor \n",
      "changes in the Penn tagset. They are grouped into one group. The second \n",
      "category of tags is of those which are a modification over the Penn \n",
      "tagset. The last group is of all those tags which are not present in \n",
      "the Penn tagset. They have been designed to cater some phenomena which \n",
      "are specific to Indian languages. \n",
      " \n",
      "Group 1- \n",
      " \n",
      "All tags in this group are similar to the Penn tagset. Penn tagset \n",
      "makes finer distinction between singular and plural or comparative and \n",
      "superlative forms, which is not considered in the current tagger. This \n",
      "is in accordance with our policy about fineness and coarseness. \n",
      " \n",
      "NN Noun \n",
      " \n",
      "Penn tagset makes a distinction between noun singular and noun plural. \n",
      "As mentioned earlier, this distinction is avoided here. This reduces \n",
      "the number of tags and thus enhances machine learning. Plurality is not \n",
      "crucial information with respect to dependancy level parsing or any \n",
      "other higher level analysis of the sentence. As said before if that \n",
      "information is needed at a later stage it can be incorporated with the \n",
      "help of heuristics and linguistic rules. \n",
      " \n",
      "NNP Proper Nouns \n",
      " \n",
      "This tag is also similar to the Penn tagset. Here too we have not made \n",
      "a distinction between Proper Noun singular and Proper Noun plural as in \n",
      "the Penn tagset. \n",
      " \n",
      "PRP Pronoun \n",
      " \n",
      "Penn tagset makes a distinction between personal pronouns and \n",
      "possessive pronouns. This distinction is avoided here. All pronouns are \n",
      "marked as PRP. In Indian languages all pronouns inflect for all cases \n",
      "(accusative, dative, possessive etc.) Incase we have a separate tag for \n",
      "possessive pronouns; new tags will have to be designed for all the \n",
      "cases. This will increase the number of tags which is unnecessary. So, \n",
      "only one tag is used for all pronouns.  \n",
      " \n",
      "VAUX Verb Auxiliary \n",
      " \n",
      "All auxiliary verbs will be marked as VAUX. This tag has been adopted \n",
      "as such from the Penn tagset. \n",
      " \n",
      "JJ Adjective \n",
      " \n",
      "This tag is again same as in Penn tagset. Penn tagset also makes a \n",
      "distinction between comparative and superlative adjectives. This has \n",
      "not been considered here.  \n",
      " \n",
      "So this tag includes the 'tara'(comparative) and the 'tama' \n",
      "(superlative) forms of adjectives in Hindi. \n",
      "e.g. adhikatara, sarvottama, etc. \n",
      "   (\"more times\", \"best\") \n",
      " \n",
      "RB Adverb \n",
      " \n",
      "This tag is the same RB tag of Penn tagset. Penn tagset also makes a \n",
      "difference between comparative and superlative adverbs, which is not \n",
      "adopted in this tagger. This is in accordance with our philosophy of \n",
      "coarseness in linguistic analysis. \n",
      " \n",
      "RP Particle  \n",
      " \n",
      "In Indian languages words like bhI, sA, etc. (Hindi for example) will \n",
      "be marked as RP.  \n",
      " \n",
      "CC Conjuncts (coordinating and subordinating) \n",
      " \n",
      "The tag CC will be used for coordinating and subordinating conjuncts \n",
      "both. The Penn tagset has used ‘IN’ tag for prepositions and \n",
